## Overview

This project involves performing a market segmentation analysis on a dataset from McDonald's to understand customer behavior and preferences. Using various data analysis techniques, the project aims to extract meaningful segments from customer data and visualize the results to gain insights into different customer groups.

## Contents

1. **Importing Libraries**: Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering are imported.
2. **Load Dataset**: The dataset `mcdonalds.csv` is loaded, providing initial insights into its structure.
3. **Demographic Segmentation**:
   - **Gender**: Visualized using a pie chart.
   - **Age**: Analyzed with a count plot to understand the age distribution of customers.
4. **Psychographic Segmentation**:
   - **Like**: Analyzed using a swarm plot to see how customer preferences vary with age.
5. **Data Preparation**:
   - Conversion of categorical data into numerical format for further analysis.
6. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - PCA is performed to reduce dimensionality and visualize principal components.
7. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - K-Means clustering is applied to segment the customers into clusters.
   - The optimal number of clusters is determined, and the results are relabelled and visualized.
8. **Segment Descriptions**:
   - Analysis of cluster characteristics and visualization of segments using mosaic plots and box plots.
9. **Target Segment Selection**:
   - Evaluation of segments based on various metrics like 'VisitFrequency', 'Like', and 'Gender'.
   - A scatter plot is used for segment evaluation.
