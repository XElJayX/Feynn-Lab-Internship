## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and segment the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India. By leveraging multiple datasets and applying various analytical techniques, the project provides insights into customer demographics, preferences, and market opportunities. The analysis helps in identifying key market segments and formulating strategic recommendations for targeting these segments effectively.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Examine and preprocess datasets related to the Indian EV market.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct descriptive statistics and visualize key data attributes.
- **Market Segmentation**: Apply K-Means clustering to segment the market based on customer preferences and demographics.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Develop actionable insights and recommendations based on the segmented market.

## Datasets

1. **Dataset 1**: EV market data with vehicle specifications and pricing.
2. **Dataset 2**: State-wise vehicle statistics in India.
3. **Dataset 3**: Customer preferences and demographic data for EVs.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checked and handled missing values.
   - Standardized data types and formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary of numerical attributes.
   - **Data Visualization**: Plots and histograms to visualize distributions and trends.

3. **Clustering and Segmentation**
   - Applied K-Means clustering to segment the market into five distinct clusters.
   - Evaluated clusters based on demographic and preference attributes.

4. **Market Insights**
   - Identified key market segments and their characteristics.
   - Developed a strategic approach for targeting high-potential segments, especially in Maharashtra and Pune.

## Key Findings
